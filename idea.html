							<p>The National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) was established under the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) to develop and implement Singapore's domestic and international policies and strategies to tackle climate change. They are currently holding a nation-wide public consultation exercise to gather feedback on Singapore’s climate change policy from now till 30 August. <a href="https://www.nccs.gov.sg/docs/default-source/default-document-library/2050-public-consultation-document.pdf" target="_blank">This document</a> outlines the areas of concern they are looking to gather feedback from. All feedback or replies are to be emailed to <a href="mailto:nccs_contact@pmo.gov.sg">nccs_contact@pmo.gov.sg.</a>

							<b style="color:#90EEA9;"> This is a prime opportunity to show the government that the climate crisis is an issue that Singaporeans (not just green groups) deeply care about and that there is consensus that greater governmental action is required.</b> According to a global survey conducted by the Pew Research Centre, climate change is the world’s greatest threat. While the government has declared 2018 the Year of Climate Action, what we need is action on a wider scale. We need concrete, structural change and a <b style="color: rgb(121,247,209);">pledge and plan to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,</b> a necessary target to limit warming to 1.5ºC. Currently, Singapore’s climate policies are consistent with a global warming of 4ºC above pre-industrial levels and our absolute emissions are still increasing. With the bulk of Singapore’s energy consumption coming from industries (65.7% - with more than half of that from petroleum products, compared to 17.6% from transportation and 5% from households.), our environmental messaging must go beyond the individual to tackle emissions reductions effectively.

							At the same time, we understand that not everyone has the capacity to craft a submission. As such, we’ve compiled a list of possible evidence-based talking points that you may use or take inspiration from in order to develop a submission of your own in the fastest way possible - no acknowledgement necessary.

							<h3>1. The need for more ambitious national targets</h3>
							<p>
							<ul><li>Publicly commit to shifting our national energy grid to be at least 70-85% renewable-based by 2050, a climate mitigation goal necessary to keep warming below 1.5ºC as laid out in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report.</li>
							<li>At the international level, declare that we are no longer a developing country and be held up to higher standards - more stringent reporting standards and financial contributions to climate related initiative.</li>
							<li>Our existing Intended Nationally Determined Contributions is a 36% reduction in emissions intensity, but there is a need to emphasise reducing absolute emissions.</li>
							<li>Regardless, the current target of a 36% reduction in emissions intensity is also too low when benchmarked with what IPCC Report has laid out, which require absolute emissions to decline by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and reach net zero around 2050 in order for temperatures to increase no more than 1.5 degrees celsius.</li>

								<ul>
								<li>Under the Paris Agreement, there are different provisions for countries categorised as developed or developing countries - Developed countries are subject to more stringent reporting requirements and need to allocate financial assistance to developing, while developing countries are subject to less stringent reporting requirements.

							<li><b style="color:#90EEA9;">Emissions Intensity” vs. “Absolute Emissions” vs. “Emissions per capita"</b>
								<ul>
								<li>Emissions Intensity is Absolute Emissions over GDP, while Absolute Emissions is the absolute amount of carbon emissions. This means that even if emissions intensity is lowered, absolute emissions will continue to rise as long as GDP keeps increasing. The climate only cares about the total amount of carbon emitted, not the amount of GDP we humans have!</li>
								<li>There is also a difference between Emissions Intensity and Emissions per capita. Emissions per capita refer to total emissions over total population, giving us an average. This figure includes industry contributions when calculating total emissions, which skews the figure because households contribute much less to total emissions than industry.<li>
								</ul>
							<li><b style="color:#90EEA9;">"Mitigation"</b>
								<ul>
								<li>Mitigation refers to cutting down on emissions so as to minimize the effects of climate change directly i.e. targeting the root cause. Adaptation refers to making the population and environment more resilient to the impacts of climate change.</li>
